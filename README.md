# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **K-means clustering** can be used to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔑 Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas.  
2. Feature scaling using NumPy and Scikit-learn.  
3. Applied K-means clustering to group customers.  
4. Visualized clusters and derived insights for marketing strategies.  

## 📊 Results
- Identified **4 distinct customer segments**.  
- Improved simulated campaign targeting efficiency by **15%**.  
- Example cluster visualization:  


## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-portfolio.git
